# Frontend Changes - Code Quality Tools

## Overview
Added essential code quality tools to the development workflow to ensure consistent code formatting and maintain high code standards throughout the codebase.

## Changes Made

### 1. Code Quality Dependencies
Added the following development dependencies to `pyproject.toml`:
- **black** (>=24.0.0) - Automatic code formatting
- **flake8** (>=7.0.0) - Linting and style checking
- **isort** (>=5.13.0) - Import sorting
- **pre-commit** (>=3.0.0) - Git hooks for automated quality checks

### 2. Configuration Files

#### `pyproject.toml` Configurations:
- **Black**: Line length 88, Python 3.13 target, with appropriate exclusions
- **isort**: Black profile compatibility, 88 character line length, known first-party modules

#### `.flake8` Configuration:
- Max line length: 88 characters (matching black)
- Ignores E203, W503 (black compatibility)
- Excludes common directories (.venv, __pycache__, etc.)

#### `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:
- Pre-commit hooks for automatic code quality enforcement
- Includes trailing whitespace, end-of-file-fixer, YAML checking
- Runs isort, black, and flake8 on commit

### 3. Development Scripts
Created executable scripts in `scripts/` directory:

#### `scripts/format.sh`:
- Runs isort for import sorting
- Runs black for code formatting
- Provides feedback on completion

#### `scripts/lint.sh`:
- Runs flake8 for linting checks
- Checks import order with isort --check-only
- Checks code format with black --check
- Non-destructive validation

#### `scripts/quality.sh`:
- Comprehensive quality check script
- Runs tests first, then linting
- Single command for complete validation

### 4. Applied Formatting
- Applied black formatting to all Python files in backend/
- Applied isort to organize imports consistently
- All existing code now follows the established style guide

### 5. Documentation Updates
Updated `CLAUDE.md` with new development commands:
- Installation instructions for dev dependencies
- Code quality command documentation
- Individual tool usage examples
- Integration with existing workflow

## Benefits

### Code Consistency
- All Python code now follows PEP 8 standards
- Consistent import ordering across all files
- Uniform line length and formatting

### Developer Experience
- Automated formatting reduces manual effort
- Pre-commit hooks prevent style issues
- Clear scripts for easy quality checks

### Maintainability
- Reduced code review time on style issues
- Consistent codebase for easier collaboration
- Automated quality enforcement

## Usage

### Daily Development:
```bash
# Format code before committing
bash scripts/format.sh

# Check code quality
bash scripts/lint.sh

# Run complete quality checks
bash scripts/quality.sh
```

### Installation:
```bash
# Install with quality tools
uv sync --group dev

# Set up pre-commit (optional)
uv run pre-commit install
```

## Quality Standards Enforced

1. **Code Formatting**: Black's opinionated formatting
2. **Import Organization**: isort with black profile
3. **Line Length**: 88 characters maximum
4. **Style Compliance**: PEP 8 via flake8
5. **File Hygiene**: Trailing whitespace, end-of-file fixing

This implementation provides a solid foundation for maintaining code quality while being developer-friendly and non-intrusive to the existing workflow.
